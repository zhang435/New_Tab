# New_Tab
this is one of my JS learning Project.
It does not has any fancy functionality.
In short, All it can do is open link in the new tab

I find out it happens to me when I working with Leetcode that
all the link will open on current tab, once I finished the question,
I need to go back to prev question list page, it need to load and re-filter
again.

I made three different mode base on user preference


Quick note, If you want , hold contorl/command will open the link in the new tab..
## OR
Or mode enable user to add link into the table, *New_Tab* will only
run the url with the domain

Example:
if you add **www.github.com** into table, all the link in github.com
will open in the new tab. Also, All the page under www.github.com/*** will
open in the new tab as well.

---
## XOR
Some user may want all tabs open in the excpet a few.
XOR will NOT work for the links that in the table

Example:
if you add **www.github.com** into table, all other links will able to
open links in the new tabs but not anything **github.com**


---
## ALL
This is simple, EVEYRTHING will open in new tab

While, I have problem with ebay and youtube becuase of some security policy
that I am not sure how to deal with....
